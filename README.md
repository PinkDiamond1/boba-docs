# Boba Network

{% hint style="info" %}
Hi there! Please take note that OMGX Network has rebranded to Boba Network and you might stumble across some old code references to OMGX!
{% endhint %}

Boba Network is an Optimistic Rollup that combines the great open source work done by [Optimism](https://community.optimism.io/) with the research and development effort of the Enya & Boba team on swap-based onramp, fast exit and cross-chain bridging. We chose to build on Optimism because it is essentially a modified version of Ethereum, which makes it relatively easy to ensure EVM and Solidity compatibility, minimizing the efforts required to migrate smart contracts from L1 to L2.

Boba is maintained by the [OMG](https://omg.network) and [Enya](https://enya.ai) teams.

Our documentation is a work in progress. If you have questions or feel like something is missing check out our [Discord server](https://omg.eco/support) where we are actively responding, or [open an issue](https://github.com/omgnetwork) in the GitHub repo for this site.

### Porting to Boba and Optimism

**Do you want to deploy your smart contracts to an Optimistic Rollup?**

#### Choose your deployment stack

#### Fix possible errors step by step

These examples take you through the complete process of deploying an application to **Optimistic Rollups**. It's not very different from simply deploying to Ethereum. We're working hard to make sure any changes to your software stack are relatively minimal.

### Set up The Graph

### **Access OMGX Wallet Contracts**

Looking ahead, we anticipate the need for L2 solutions to not only scale Ethereum, but to augment it by expanding the capabilities of smart contracts through enabling complex off-chain computations. Boba strives to be at the forefront of this evolution.
