# Welcome to OMGX

### What is OMGX?

OMGX is an optimistic rollup that combines the great work done by the [Optimism team](https://community.optimism.io) with the research and development effort of the OMG team on fast exits and bridging in order to deliver the best user experience for moving liquidity into and out of OMGX. OMGX is currently available in private test net, and will enter public test net in a few weeks. We are ramping up developer support as quickly as we can to accommodate as many projects as possible on the test net.

### Get started building on OMGX

Looking ahead, we anticipate the need for L2 solutions to not only scale Ethereum, but to augment it by expanding the capabilities of smart contracts through enabling complex off-chain computations. OMGX strives to be at the forefront of this evolution.

Heads Up

Our documentation is a rapidly improving work in progress. If you have questions or feel like something is missing feel free to ask in our [Discord server](https://omg.eco/support) where we \(and our awesome community\) are actively responding, or [open an issue](https://github.com/ScopeLift/ovm-uniswap-v2-core) in the GitHub repo for this site.

### For Developers <a id="for-developers"></a>

**Are you a developer who wants to deploy a smart contract to OMGX?**

{% page-ref page="developer-docs/case-studies/" %}

The case studies take you through the complete process of deploying an application to **OMGX**. It's not very different from simply deploying to Ethereum. We're working hard to make sure any changes to your software stack are relatively minimal.
