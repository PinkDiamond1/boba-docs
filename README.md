# Welcome to OMGX

### What is OMGX?

OMGX is an optimistic rollup that combines the great work done by the [Optimism team](https://community.optimism.io) with the research and development effort of the OMG team on fast exits and bridging in order to deliver the best user experience for moving liquidity into and out of OMGX. OMGX is currently available in private test net, and will enter public test net in a few weeks. We are ramping up developer support as quickly as we can to accommodate as many projects as possible on the test net.

### Get started building on OMGX

Looking ahead, we anticipate the need for L2 solutions to not only scale Ethereum, but to augment it by expanding the capabilities of smart contracts through enabling complex off-chain computations. OMGX strives to be at the forefront of this evolution.

Heads Up

Our documentation is a rapidly improving work in progress. If you have questions or feel like something is missing feel free to ask in our [Discord server](https://omg.eco/support) where we \(and our awesome community\) are actively responding, or [open an issue](https://github.com/ScopeLift/ovm-uniswap-v2-core) in the GitHub repo for this site.

### For: The Casually Interested Reader <a id="for-the-casually-interested-reader"></a>

**Are you here because you're interested in Optimistic OMGX at a high-level?**

**We'd recommend starting with the** [**Optimistic Ethereum TL;DR**.](faq.md#what-is-omgx)

It's got a great explanation of the protocol at a high-level. No deep Ethereum experience necessary.

If you don't find that page to be sufficiently deep, you can always check out our page explaining the Optimistic Ethereum [protocol in detail](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/protocol.html).

Don't have the time for docs?

Check out this [collection of talks and videos](https://community.optimism.io/docs/resources/talks.html) to help you understand Optimistic Ethereum. We'll even throw in the fun audio and visuals for free. It's like the world's best portable source of esoteric blockchain knowledge!

### For: Developers <a id="for-developers"></a>

**Are you a developer who wants to deploy a smart contract to Optimistic OMGX?**

{% page-ref page="developer-docs/case-studies/porting-sushi-omgx.md" %}

This guide takes you through the complete process of deploying an application to **OMGX**. It's not very different from simply deploying to Ethereum. We're working hard to make sure any changes to your software stack are relatively minimal.

If you're looking for something else, you may wish to search through our more complete list of [Guides and Resources](https://community.optimism.io/docs/resources/tutorials.html) and catalog of [useful developer tooling](developer-docs/tooling.md).

Just want to play with the system?

### For: Protocol Information <a id="for-protocol-information"></a>

**Looking to understand Optimistic Ethereum in depth?**

**Head over to our** [**Protocol in Detail**](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/protocol.html) **page.**

You won't find a more detailed description of the system anywhere else. This is probably most useful if you want to learn how Optimistic Ethereum works under the hood.

You definitely don't _need_ to go through this material in order to build applications on top of the system. However, it's quite fascinating stuff and we won't stop you from reading it ðŸ˜Š.
