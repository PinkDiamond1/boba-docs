  This guide will walk through the process of porting an existing Solidity
  project to support execution on the Optimism Layer 2 network. For our example
  codebase, we’ll use the Uniswap Protocol.

# Porting Solidity Contracts to OMGx

We’ll go through the process of modifying the Compound repository so it can support deployment on the Optimistic Virtual Machine \(OVM\) and the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\).

At the end of this guide, you’ll have a test suite that runs on both the EVM and the OVM! You’ll also have a good idea of what it takes to get _your_ Solidity project up and running on OMGx.
