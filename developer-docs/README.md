# OVM 1.0



{% hint style="info" %}
**!!! Important Update !!!**  
  
Boba Network will implement OVM 2.0 very soon, therefore there are no more custom changes needed for L1 contracts in order to deploy to Boba. Due to a chain re-genesis all contracts will have to be re-compiled and re-deployed. If you're preparing to deploy to Boba, make sure that your contracts run fine on any Ethereum L1 testnet. **No more code re-factoring is required to migrate to Boba Network with OVM 2.0**
{% endhint %}
