# Transaction Fees OVM 3.0

## Transaction Fees in OVM 3.0 <a id="frontmatter-title"></a>

This page refers to the **new** state of Boba Network after the OVM 3.0 update (deployed Feb. 1 2022).

### Fees in a nutshell <a id="fees-in-a-nutshell"></a>

Fees on Boba are, for the most part, significantly lower than on the Ethereum mainnet. The cost of every transaction is the sum of two values:

1. Your L2 \(execution\) fee, and
2. Your L1 \(security\) fee.

At a high level, the L2 fee is the cost to execute your transaction in L2 and the L1 fee is the estimated cost to submit your transaction to L1 \(in a rollup batch\).

1. **L2 execution fee** is charged as `tx.gasPrice * l2GasUsed` \(up to `tx.gasLimit`\). The L2 gas price will vary depending on network congestion.
2. **L1 security fee** is charged as `l1GasPrice * l1GasUsed ` . This is the cost of storing the transaction's data on L1.
   * `l1GasPrice` is the same as the normal gas price in L1 Ethereum
   * `l1GasUsed` is calculated as `1.2*(overhead + calldataGas)`. Thus, more calldata your transaction includes, the more expensive your L1 fee will be. For example, an ETH transfer has no calldata, so it will have the cheapest L1 fee, whereas large contract deployments can have over 25kb of calldata and will result in a high L1 fee. We currently just the overhead value to the L1 fee to ensure the fee paid covers the actual L1 costs.
2. **Total cost** is calculated as `tx.gasPrice * (l2GasUsed + l1GasPrice * l1GasUsed / tx.gasPrice)`. The L2 gas Used is higher than l1, because we add the **L1 security fee**. 
   * The gas uage of transferring ETH is 26730 on Boba Network. It includes 21000 (l2GasUsed) and 5370 (l1SecurityFee).

To obtain ETH on Boba Network you can deposit ETH via[ https://gateway.boba.network](https://gateway.boba.network) on both Rinkeby or Mainnet. Soon you will be able to also deposit ETH for slightly cheaper via [Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router).
